Aim4Glory
=============
iPhone game using Cocos2D for iPhone game programming class @ ITBA (Buenos Aires' Institute of Technology)

This game was built following [a tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/25736/how-to-make-a-simple-iphone-game-with-cocos2d-2-x-tutorial) by Ray Wenderlich as a base to learn basics on iPhone development with cocos2D.
The game is still under construction and the original idea includes:
- Multiple types of proyectiles
- A screen in which you can invest your money
- A final Boss
- Better sound effects and music
- Better graphics for monsters
- Different playability (multitouch support)

Feel free to use the game for everything you want, as long as you are aware of the origin of it.
